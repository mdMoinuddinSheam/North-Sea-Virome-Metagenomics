# North-Sea-Virome-Metagenomics

Metagenomic analysis of the diversity of bacteriophages in the North Sea. The study was performed at the Flanders Marine Institute, Ostend, Belgium as my Master thesis.

Bioinformatic analysis of the metagenomic reads were performed using high performance computing (HPC) clusters. The quality of the raw reads were assesed, followed by trimming of low quality reads and subsequent assembly into contigs. Finally, the bacteriophages were classified astronomically and protein sequence genes, bacterial hosts and life history of the phages were predicted.

# North-Sea-Virome-Metagenomics

As part of my Master thesis at the Flanders Marine Institute in Ostend, Belgium, this study performs metagenomic analysis of the diversity of bacteriophages in the North Sea.

Bioinformatic analysis of the metagenomic reads were performed using high performance computing (HPC) clusters. The quality of the raw reads were assesed, followed by trimming of low quality reads and subsequent assembly into contigs. Finally, the bacteriophages were classified taxonomically and protein sequence genes, bacterial hosts and life history of the phages were predicted.
